# Multimodal Chatbot
 We designed and built a conversational chatbot that could interact with the user via voice input/output as well as text output/input through Telegram Channel. The chatbot uses speech-to-text(STT), text-to-speech(TTS) and natural language processing(NLP) techniques to generate conversations that sound natural, and provide correct responses accordingly
